This is a simple Pong game.

The "Ball.lua" is a class that contains the methods of the ball in the game.\
The "Paddle.lua" is a class that contains the methods of the paddles in the game.

All methods in these class are self-explanatory.

The file "push.lua" belongs to github.com/Ulydev/push and is used with the funcionality of
focus on something in the game with a fixed resolution.

The song files was generated by myself using a program called "Bfxr".
